      <description>Roze is an activist, poet and programmer living in Queens. During their college years studying computer science, they took heritage Urdu courses, never expecting to stumble into the world of Urdu poetry. The following essay explores four verses — from Sauda and Ghalib — and how they speak to love, annihilation, divinity, and the fragile mirrors through which we attempt to know the world. I saw my Lord with the eye of the heart.</description>

      <description>Ghazals 🔗Overview
Originating in 7th century Arabia, this form of shayari has historically focused on matters of love (spiritual or worldy), with a particular emphasis on separation and reunification with the beloved. While the technical constraints are strict, ghazals do not need to have a single topic running through the poem. Rather, they emphasize a tone or a mood more than any narrative continuity. Often abstract, ghazals employ contradictions, opposites and multiplicities of meaning.</description>

      <title>The Genesis of Urdu</title>

      <description>Legend has it that Urdu began with the Mughal invasions of the Indian Subcontinent. Bred in diverse war camps – the word is derived from the Turkish ‘ordu’ meaning army – Urdu has often been portrayed as a khichri of Turkish, Farsi, Arabic and Hindi originally used for military communications. Growing up, a friend of mine liked to recount that Urdu began with the poetic genius of Amir Khusrao, who wove verses from Farsi and local dialects into language forming ghazals.</description>

      <description>Urdu shayari has a long history of reflexive verse. Classical ghazals are known to contain verses that adulate and praise the Urdu language. Here we will focus on modern works that reflect how words and language are signified, as well as on the form of poetry itself (metapoetry). We’ll then think together about what we conceive of as ‘poems’, using that as a place to start writing our own work.</description>

      <description>— Allegory of Worldly and Otherworldly Drunkenness, Divan-e-Hafiz
Introduction 🔗Wine poetry has a long and fascinating history in Urdu, Hindi, Farsi and Arabic. The genre of khamirriya in pre-Islamic Arabia is an early instance of wine imagery and symbolism constituting an entire subgenre of poetry. The genre would take on new meanings with the introduction of Islam in the 7th century. Alongside khamirriya, the Farsi saqinama was developing in Persia, represented in Firdawsi’s Shahanama, Hafiz’s Divan and Khayyam’s rubaiyaat, among other works.</description>

      <title>The Garden 🥀</title>

      <description>The Garden is a recurring theme in Urdu shairi. From serving as a metaphor of paradise to acting as a container for other motifs (the rose, the nightingale, the moth), gardens hold varying symbolisms in adab. This week we’ll explore the garden through a writing workshop. First we’ll read a collection of ashaar where the garden and its elements play differing symbolic roles, followed by working on our own poetry using the imagery discussed.</description>

      <description>Reading is a solitary activity. On the subway, over lunch breaks, during layovers, curled up in bed – no matter where we are, the written word allows us to escape (if only momentarily) into our own world. While reading circles can provide forums for discussion and sharing the worlds we imagine with others, in my experience they can feel stuffy, require assigned reading, and become transient as people come and go.</description>

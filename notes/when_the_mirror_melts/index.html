— Mansūr al-Ḥallāj
<p>
<p><strong>Poetry as a Science</strong></p>
<p>Al-Ḥallāj’s <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> cry is not logical or deductive. It is poetic.
For centuries, poets in the Sufi world have served as metaphysicians questioning reality, selfhood,
and God not through proofs, but through verse. In the Urdu literary tradition, no poetic form has
carried this burden more beautifully than the Ghazal. In the West, we often approach these same questions through dense philosophical prose.</p>
<p>Heidegger wrote thousands of pages on “being.” Descartes turned to reason. But in Persian and Urdu traditions — shaped by Sufi thought — it is poetry that bears the weight of metaphysics. Not
essay, but image. Not exposition, but suggestion. The idiomatic nature of Persian, with its layered
meanings and flexible syntax, lends itself to this kind of mystical recursion. Ghazals don’t argue;
they shimmer.</p>
<p>During my college years studying computer science, I had to take a foreign language to graduate. I
chose Urdu mostly out of convenience since my parents speak it, never expecting to stumble into
a new world and fall in love with its poetry.</p>
<p>The ghazal does not deliver meaning plainly. It traffics in paradox, multiplicity, and feeling. It
doesn’t explain; it entangles. Its lines move like riddles whispered across centuries, riddles that
ask not to be solved, but felt. Formally, the ghazal is a type of poem composed of discrete, self-contained couplets called <em>shers</em>. Though the couplets share a topic and each <em>sher</em> is made of two lines, known as <em>misrahs</em> , common meter and end-rhyme scheme, they are not expected to continue one another. Instead, they orbit the same philosophical constellation — each one complete, yet illuminated differently by the presence of other couplets.</p>
<p>To enter a ghazal is to accept disorientation. You are not being led down a path; you are stepping
into a mirrored chamber, each reflection offering a different glimpse of desire, loss, divinity, or
doubt.</p>
<p>These poems live in a shared symbolic universe. A rose is never just a flower. A garden is never
just a garden. Poets borrow, subvert, and respond to one another across time echoing images and
lines like call and response across centuries. The ghazal is not repetition, but recursion.
This essay explores four couplets — from Sauda and Ghalib — and how they speak to love,
annihilation, the divine, and ultimately, the fragile mirrors through which we attempt to know the
world.

<strong>In the Beginning, There Was Longing</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Noto Nastaliq Urdu';font-size: 22px; line-height: 2;">
پیش از ظہور ِ مرغِ چمن خادمانِ عشق<br>
بنتے تھے رشتۂ رگِ گل دام کے لئے
<p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<i>pesh az zuhoor-e-murgh-e-chaman, khādīmān-e-‘ishq<br>
bantay thay rishta-e-rag-e-gul dām ke liye</i>
<p>
<p>Literal Translation:<br>
&ldquo;Before the appearance of the garden&rsquo;s bird (i.e., before spring), the servants of love
were weaving the veins of flowers into snares.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commentary:<br>
Mirza Muhammad Rafi Sauda (1713–1781) is often remembered for satire and spectacle, but this
couplet gestures toward something quieter, more elemental. A creation myth without gods. A
beginning stitched not by science or scripture, but by desire.
He imagines a time before time, before spring, before the world had even unfurled its colors —and
even then, the servants of love were already at work.</p>
<p>When I first read this couplet in class, I didn&rsquo;t quite grasp it. The Persian vocabulary alone slowed
me down. Yet something about the imagery played on repeat. “The bird of the garden” — how
strange and delicate. The servants of love weaving flowers felt mythic, calming. It wasn’t
until my professor explained the symbols I’d encountered that I realized I’d stumbled into a
new dimension.</p>
<p>The garden (چمن / chaman) is a recurring symbol in the ghazal tradition, often standing in for life,
beauty, or paradise. The bird of the garden (مرغِ چمن / murgh-e-chaman) represents the soul, the
poet, or life itself stirring into form. Spring isn’t just a season, it’s the beginning of being. And the bird’s appearance (ظہور / zuhūr) marks the arrival of awareness, language, selfhood.
So when Sauda writes “before the bird appeared,” he gestures toward a primordial state — pre-
language, pre-creation. A void.</p>
<p>And who dwells in that void? The servants of love.
The phrase servants of love (خادمانِ عشق / khādimān-e-‘ishq) existing before creation suggests they
are not just human lovers or poets, but cosmic weavers, forces responsible for threading the
world together. Not just for love, but for the vulnerability it demands. The trap (دام / dām) isn’t
sinister, but it is binding. To live is to be ensnared by beauty, by feeling, by the ache of wanting. In this vision, love is not an emotion; it is a law of nature that predates matter. It doesn’t follow creation — it initiates it.</p>
<p>As a computer scientist, I’ve spent most of my life surrounded by systems — mathematical, computational, efficient. We live in a world that privileges empiricism. We&rsquo;re taught about the Big Bang, dark matter, galaxies spinning. But Sauda offers a different origin story. What if it isn’t logic that holds the universe
together, but longing?</p>
<p>Even in calling them “servants,” Sauda flips the power dynamic. They are not the origin, only the
beginning of the beginning.

<p><strong>When the Mirror Melts</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Noto Nastaliq Urdu';font-size: 22px; line-height: 2;">
عبرت طلب ہے حلِ معمائے آگہی<br>
شبنم گداز آئینۂ اعتبار ہے
<p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<i>‘ibrat talab hai ḥall-e mu‘ammā-e āgahi<br>
shabnam-gudāz ā’īna-e i‘tiḳād hai</i>
<p>
<p>Literal Translation: <br>
&ldquo;The solution to the riddle of awareness demands caution; the mirror of belief melts like dewdrops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commentary:<br>
Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib (1797 – 1869) is the undisputed titan of Urdu poetry. His very name,
Ghalib, means “the conqueror” or “the boss” and one only needs to read a few of his couplets to
understand why he gave himself this title. Where other poets wept or worshipped, Ghalib
interrogated. He was never content with just beauty; he wanted the blueprints too.
This couplet is one of his most haunting warnings.</p>
<p>Personally, I imagine a leaf after a rain shower. An oval drop of water clings to the edge, and in that droplet, I catch my reflection. The entire world, inside a single glimmer. This is the Matrix, where knowledge isn’t empowering but perilous. Ghalib warns us: probe too deeply into the nature of
reality, and it begins to dissolve. The mirror — the polished surface of belief — melts like morning
dew the moment a question touches it.</p>
<p>There’s a Neoplatonic echo here: the material world as illusion, a thin reflection. Deep inquiry
doesn’t bring clarity, it dissolves the frame entirely. To seek understanding is to risk unmaking
the world. Ghalib’s <em>sher</em> reads less like an answer and more like a whispered warning: look too
closely, and the mirror won’t reflect — it will disappear.</p>
<p>As engineers and scientists, we’re trained to value concreteness, precision, and rigor. There’s
pride in solving problems, in cracking open the unknown with logic and deduction. But Ghalib
troubles that instinct. Not all riddles want to be solved. Some truths, he suggests, are too fragile to touch. The moment you examine them, they’re gone.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>After the Flame</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Noto Nastaliq Urdu';font-size: 22px; line-height: 2;">
دل میں ذوقِ وصل و یادِ یار تک باقی نہیں<br>
آگ اس گھر میں لگی ایسی کہ جو تھا جل گیا
<p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<i>dil meñ zauq-e waṣl o yād-e yār tak bāqī nahīñ<br>
aag is ghar meñ lagī aisī ki jo thā jal gayā</i>
<p>
<p>Literal Translation:<br>
&ldquo;In my heart, not even the taste of union or the memory of the beloved remains; such a fire broke
out in this house that all that was burned away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commentary:<br>
Ghalib once again turns inward. If the mirror in the last poem dissolved at the touch of awareness,
this one shatters in flame. There’s no trace of the beloved left. Not even the desire to remember
them.</p>
<p>At first glance, this couplet reads like heartbreak, a love so thoroughly lost that nothing remains.
Not the joy of reunion (waṣl), not even the ache of remembrance (yād-e-yār). Just ash. Just
absence.</p>
<p>But in the ghazal tradition, the beloved is never just a person. Sometimes they are the object of
romantic longing. Sometimes they are God. Often, they are both at once: cruel, distant, and
divine. The beloved never arrives when we need them most. That absence, that ache, is the
lifeblood of the form.</p>
<p>Here, though, the heartbreak is not loss. It is annihilation. Ghalib writes not of desire denied, but of desire extinguished. A fire so total it consumes not only love, but the capacity to long. In Sufi cosmology, fanā’ is the obliteration of the self in divine love. The heart is the house, and the fire is ecstasy. It burns so completely that even memory turns to smoke. What remains is baqā’ — a new self, scorched and enduring, defined only by what it has lost. To return to the world after union is not illumination but mourning. Ghalib is writing from that aftermath. From the stillness after the blaze. From a self that has seen the infinite and survived.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>If I had Never Been</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Noto Nastaliq Urdu';font-size: 22px; line-height: 2;">
نہ تھا کچھ تو خدا تھا، کچھ نہ ہوتا تو خدا ہوتا<br>
ڈبویا مجھ کو ہونے نے، نہ ہوتا میں تو کیا ہوتا
<p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<i>na thā kuchh to ḳhudā thā, kuchh na hotā to ḳhudā hotā<br>
ḍuboyā mujh ko hone ne, na hotā maiñ to kyā hotā</i>
<p>
<p>Literal Translation:<br>
&ldquo;When there was nothing, there was God. If there were nothing, there would still be God. It is my
being that drowned me; if I had not existed, what would have happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commentary:<br>
If Sauda speaks from the edge of creation, and Ghalib’s earlier couplets peer through the
wreckage, this one speaks from the eye of the storm. Existence itself is catastrophe.
Another of Ghalib’s, this couplet begins with a near-theological certainty: when there was nothing,
there was God. Even now, if there were nothing, God would remain. But then the second line turns
inward — and downward. It is my being that drowned me. As if to say: awareness is not
transcendence. It is weight. It is ruin.</p>
<p>This is Ghalib at his most destabilizing. The <em>sher</em> opens like a prayer and closes like a paradox.
You read it once and think you understand. Then it folds. And folds again. It’s a perfect example of
what makes the ghazal so addictive: a single couplet can contain simultaneous, contradictory,
even mutually exclusive meanings.</p>
<p>One reading is of submission: God is the constant; we are the error. The soul suffers under the
burden of its own being. If I had never existed, I might have remained with Him — free, unbroken.
Another reading feels like rebellion: God made me, and in doing so, He doomed me. Existence is
not a gift but a curse.</p>
<p>And still another is meta-poetic: Ghalib positioning himself as essential. If I had not existed, what
would have happened? Who else would have wrestled meaning from madness, language from
fire?</p>
<p>The couplet is theological, philosophical, poetic, and fundamentally unresolvable. It disturbs the
intellect and the soul at once. The ghazal does not seek clarity. It seeks the shimmer. The paradox.
The ache. In two lines, Ghalib doesn’t just ask us to ponder the mystery of existence, he makes us
feel it in our chest. And indeed, that is why he is called Ghalib — the boss, the conqueror. I am just an engineer, trained to keep data safe in a database. But I need Ghalib to understand who I am
outside of that. To glimpse the part of myself that aches, fractures, burns and still returns,
searching for longing.
<br></p>
<p><strong>What Remains After Knowing</strong></p>
<p>These couplets are not just expressions of feeling. They are ontological investigations, asking:
What is love? What is being? What is truth? What burns away when we ask too many questions —
and what, if anything, remains?In Sauda, love predates creation. In Ghalib, it shatters mirrors, burns houses, and questions the very fact of being. These are not poems to debug, they are poems to survive. Each <em>sher</em> leaves you a little less certain, a little more undone.</p>
<p>One commonly thinks of the Matrix, of taking the red pill and struggling with the truths it exposes
us to. But, the Ghazal came well before the Matrix movies were released. It depicted transness
that the Wachowski sisters may have stepped into unknowingly. The <em>shers</em> are not intrinsically
gendered. The beloved&rsquo;s gender is never specified. And indeed, poets like Ghalib were witnessing
the devastation of colonialism. A colonialism that crystalized the binary genders in a region of the
world where languages like Bangla were not gendered but became so with time. Every queer
person has felt the ache presented in these *shers, has felt the discomfort of knowing they are not
whom the world told them they are. The ghazal&rsquo;s universality shines in even Hollywood, where the
Wachowski sisters likely knew nothing of ghazals or sufism, but wished to portray this ache and
what it is to witness the mirror melt.</p>
<p>As an engineer, I try to mirror the world in code — to represent it, compute it, solve it. But code is not the world. It is a translation. And in a culture that treats science as the only valid form of
knowing, these poets remind us of something older: there are other ways of understanding. The
ghazal doesn’t offer certainty. It offers recursion. Reverberation. A thousand mirrors reflecting one
another in paradox and pain.</p>
<p>Poetry is not a lesser epistemology. It is the tool we reach for when logic fails. It is how mystics
grieve, how philosophers confess, how we approach the divine without naming it.
Perhaps that’s why I keep returning to poetry, not to analyze it, but to be changed by it. To
remember that before there was order, there was desire. Before there was light, there was longing.
And that maybe what holds the universe together isn’t atoms, but ache.
And the poets? They were its first scientists. Smashing clocks to understand time. Colliding words
like particles. Breaking lines, twisting meanings, pressing language to its edge — and in doing so,
illuminate what logic alone cannot reach.</p>

<p>Born in 9th-century Persia, Hallāj was a mystic who wandered through Baghdad, speaking in
riddles and burning with divine love. He’s best remembered for the phrase that doomed him: “Ana
al-Ḥaqq” — I am the Truth. Orthodox authorities condemned the phrase as blasphemy. To call
oneself the Truth, one of God’s names, was seen as shirk, the unforgivable sin of associating
oneself with God. For this, Hallāj was tortured, had his hands and feet cut off, and was paraded
through the streets before his execution. But Sufis saw something else. For them, it wasn&rsquo;t arrogance that caused al-Ḥallāj to repeatedly cry Ana al-Ḥaqq, but rather aftermath. A soul so consumed by the Divine that, upon return, language fractured as if human speech was inadequate to describe what he had seen. He no longer spoke as himself, but as what remained. His poetry, his madness, even his death were signs of baqā’ — a new self that lives only through God. The annihilation (fanā’) had already occurred. “Ana al-Ḥaqq” was the voice that came after&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

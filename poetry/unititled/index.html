    <div class="content">
      <p>Two brothers walked in the alleyway <br>
the way I wish I could with you</p>
<p>My uncle asked: do you pray for America or Pakistan? <br>
I said both, ashamed of my disbelief</p>
<p>Here faith is rain and I seek truth in the nuqta <br>
In our chowk the smog chokes like time did when I put garlands in her hair or <br>
the moment before a drone converts a village to an archaeology</p>
<p>Let me tell you a secret: the winter smog is riverwater<br>
evaporating from the void of a zero point border <br>
A conspiracy of the line against the nuqta <br>
Today the mob was overheard saying: should the white rectangle be cut? <br>
And you cried for the voiceless in a way that finds me years later <br>
suspended out over an Atlantic ozone</p>
<p>I dont know where you really are <br>
I only visit briefly, a thief giving alms <br>
See the well was dug and they hit ink instead of water <br>
but I looked closer and it was blood</p>
<p>I climbed deeper and there were checkpoints <br>
architected into childhood, in the absence of  baba or <br>
before the time of Buddha</p>
<p>Years have been spent curating this archaeology <br>
crumbling before a gaze that deems them counterfeit</p>
<p>This is your captain speaking: Its 42 degrees centigrade outside <br>
and welcome back to the sunrise <br>
Our encounters are a palimpsest and <br>
I begin to unpack language from the suitcase</p>

      <description>The Garden is a recurring theme in Urdu shairi. From serving as a metaphor of paradise to acting as a container for other motifs (the rose, the nightingale, the moth), gardens hold varying symbolisms in adab. This week we’ll explore the garden through a writing workshop. First we’ll read a collection of ashaar where the garden and its elements play differing symbolic roles, followed by working on our own poetry using the imagery discussed.</description>

      <description>Ghazals 🔗Overview
Originating in 7th century Arabia, this form of shairi has historically focused on matters of love (spiritual or worldy), with a particular emphasis on separation and reunification with the beloved. While the technical constraints are strict, ghazals do not need to have a single topic running through the poem. Rather, they emphasize a tone or a mood more than any narrative continuity. Often abstract, ghazals employ contradictions, opposites and multiplicities of meaning.</description>

      <description>Reading is, for most of us, a solitary activity. On the subway, over lunch breaks, during layovers, curled up in bed - no matter where we are, books allows us to escape, if only momentarily, into our own world. While reading circles can provide forums for discussion, and for sharing the worlds we build during reading with others, in my experience they can feel stuffy, require assigned reading, and become transient as people come and go.</description>

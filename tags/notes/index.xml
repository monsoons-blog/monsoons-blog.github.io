      <description>Legend has it that Urdu began with the Mughal invasions of the Indian Subcontinent. Bred in diverse war camps ‚Äì the word is derived from the Turkish ‚Äòordu‚Äô meaning army ‚Äì Urdu has often been portrayed as a khichri of Turkish, Farsi, Arabic and Hindi originally used for military communications. Growing up, a friend of mine liked to recount that Urdu began with the poetic genius of Amir Khusrao, who wove verses from Farsi and local dialects into language forming ghazals.</description>

      <description>The Garden is a recurring theme in Urdu shairi. From serving as a metaphor of paradise to acting as a container for other motifs (the rose, the nightingale, the moth), gardens hold varying symbolisms in adab. This week we‚Äôll explore the garden through a writing workshop. First we‚Äôll read a collection of ashaar where the garden and its elements play differing symbolic roles, followed by working on our own poetry using the imagery discussed.</description>

      <description>Ghazals üîóOverview
Originating in 7th century Arabia, this form of shairi has historically focused on matters of love (spiritual or worldy), with a particular emphasis on separation and reunification with the beloved. While the technical constraints are strict, ghazals do not need to have a single topic running through the poem. Rather, they emphasize a tone or a mood more than any narrative continuity. Often abstract, ghazals employ contradictions, opposites and multiplicities of meaning.</description>

      <title>Shairi notes: On community building</title>

      <description>Reading is, for most of us, a solitary activity. On the subway, over lunch breaks, during layovers, curled up in bed - no matter where we are, books allows us to escape, if only momentarily, into our own world. While reading circles can provide forums for discussion, and for sharing the worlds we build during reading with others, in my experience they can feel stuffy, require assigned reading, and become transient as people come and go.</description>

      <description>ज़िंदगी में लोगों की कमी नहीं पर वो नहीं मिले
जिनके वजह से वक़्त की क़दर हो जाये और लहरें थम सी जाएं जिनके साथ वक़्त भी नहीं मुक़ाबला कर पाए और सुबह से पहले शाम हो जाये
जो यादों में हमेशा से थे लेकिन नज़रों में अब तक नहीं
जिनके लिए कसमें वाअदे किए लेकिन बातें अब तक नाकें
पर शायद उन लोगों के रस्ते हमेशा से अलग थे मंज़िल एक ही सही ज़िंदगी में लोगों की कमी नहीं पर शायद ज़िंदगी के बाद ही मिलेंगे आख़िर वो कहीं</description>

      <description>nostalgic piety and I break with fruit ablution clarity, repeatedly and increasingly and defeatedly water is drawn over post truth calluses, slathered: Over this body in beauty – that’s all that matters, the sublime – dancing – yes I’m not practicing – any day now my son you will return. I (hypocrite) stand gleaming by the kitchen sink, turning to look at her unrotten hope, fearing its expiration when she hands me fruit</description>

      <description>Late to play, I rush to him Allahu la ilaha – the rhythmic murmur begins he blows hurriedly on his restive child Climbing trees, eating muddy leaves – I frisk, I fall Back at home, solace lingers unbound
A wrinkled, disquiet hand my grip gently placating his A hospital bed basking in sunlight Dada’s intent gaze – reading mine Asked me not to stay, said no goodbyes
In the garage of my ancestral home, laid a loved one’s coffin A moment of unassailable grief slightly eased Untouched by words – my palm, gently squeezed</description>

      <description>Surbahar plays heart out to nothing Stepping out past step or notion Life is best lived remotely – that childhood Observing only (sentiment sealing (sophisticated security)) Listen it&amp;rsquo;s quite blue after a hundred notes and silent after a thousand? It&amp;rsquo;s the blankness of your eyes aajkal Akin to modern masters, their vacant canvas or patternless jazz Shows over, airtight silence hums under, dark sky over The way wind interrogates through unsemantic beauty.</description>

      <description>Jostling against tiny shoulders You make your way through A moment’s pause at the threshold – No time to spare A hurried entrance A foregone goodbye What is this place? First glance – Eyes met with grandeur An apparent immaculacy Ceilings high Walls paneled A grand chandelier Over a marble floor A helical staircase Carved handrails Going up Going down Take your pick There’s some noise downstairs A jamboree of sorts You walk towards it And look up The light falling through the skylight Equally enticing Time is running fast How do you choose?</description>

      <description>Cook with the meat on the bone I rip through myself looking for bones Authenticity, I only seek things I don&amp;rsquo;t believe in, God Here are the maps my uncles prepared
The scrolls soak in tea until the borders disappear into milk I tell other people who they are not so that I can name myself
It&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted — a new name Same skin, new bones, white milk, home My uncle asks if I pray for here or home I stay silent, suspended in disbelief</description>

      <title>Shairi notes: On community building</title>
      <link>https://monsoons-blog.github.io/notes/community/</link>

      <description>Reading is, for most of us, a solitary activity. On the subway, over lunch breaks, during layovers, curled up in bed - no matter where we are, books allows us to escape, if only momentarily, into our own world. While reading circles can provide forums for discussion, and for sharing the worlds we build during reading with others, in my experience they can feel stuffy, require assigned reading, and become transient as people come and go.</description>

      <description>two thousand years ago with my bare eye i encountered a Mars of spore &amp;amp; dry grass. but
here mildew permeates my routine. i spray the killer, spray &amp;amp; shine &amp;amp; behold! a circumstantial vacuum
concedes my sins &amp;amp; perfect absence feels so near. now look below: i, the tollund
man, am buried here and my grimace forewarns of a particular home-video-grief. now am I
speaking to a grandfather or some artificial intelligence?</description>

      <description>Confusing myself for the bad deed
I woke up at sunrise and said: not anymore Like escaping your own smell And I would molt skin and bone but my ancestor said: the scent lingers
Incarcerated firefighters today announced a breakthrough I was heartbroken in believing the progress
Retaliations confused us, we thought we had quenched it safely in the near east (the far west) until the jungles melted to a virus of trash bags masked in tropical fragrance</description>

      <description>Two brothers walked in the alleyway the way I wish I could with you
My uncle asked: do you pray for America or Pakistan? I said both, ashamed of my disbelief
Here faith is rain and I seek truth in the nuqta In our chowk the smog chokes like time did when I put garlands in her hair or the moment before a drone converts a village to an archaeology</description>

      <description>I was a believer and it&amp;rsquo;s wildfire season
Prove yourself to your homelands but dont move back My corporation goes to trial and settles: intermittent recycling programs My algorithm suggests buying crescent moon jewelry Dear all: but all too late. Flooding fires, fiery floods, the flight I unoriginate away in the ozone tearing privilege of heritage jetting
Responsibility shoved into words: this poem The confusion of profit, of prophets Iconoclasm: surgical strike of the starbucks straws Common bloodletting amongst the dunes (Allahuakbar)</description>

      <title>1 dead at Arcade America</title>

      <description>For three minutes, twenty-one players at Arcade America watched Sameer convulse on the floor.
Witnesses recall Sameer Shaheed, a 12-year-old refugee boy, calling out before the time of his death. Sameer had been playing Stormhill, a popular virtual reality game set in a fictionalized version of his home country.
“I remember being scared at the time. His words sounded like the bad guys from Stormhill,” said Lyola Thomas, a frequent customer at Arcade America.</description>
